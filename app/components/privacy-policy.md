WEAVEIT AGENT PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: December 17, 2025

1. INTRODUCTION WeaveItAgent ("WeaveIt," "we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal and technical data you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you access our platform, connect your Solana wallet, or use our AI-driven educational services (the "Services").
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT: We collect information in four categories:
   A. Personal Information: If you create an account or subscribe, we may collect your name, email address, and username.
   B. Blockchain & Wallet Data: When you connect a wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare), we collect your public wallet address and transaction history related to the $WEAV token. We do not have access to your private keys or seed phrases.
   C. AI Input Data: This includes the code repositories, technical documentation, PDFs, and URLs you upload for analysis, as well as the text prompts you enter.
   D. Biometric & Voice Data: If you use our voice cloning features, we collect the voice samples you upload. This is considered sensitive biometric data.
3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION: We use your data strictly to provide and improve the Service:
   Service Delivery: To generate the video tutorials, summaries, and quizzes you request.
   AI Processing: Your code and voice samples are processed by our AI models solely to generate the specific output you requested.
   Transaction Verification: To confirm your $WEAV token balance or process "pay-per-prompt" payments on the Solana blockchain.
   Safety & Compliance: To detect and prevent deepfakes, fraud, or the generation of malicious content.
4. SHARING OF INFORMATION: We do not sell your personal data. However, we must share data with specific infrastructure providers to function:
   Third-Party AI Providers: We transmit your input text and voice samples to third-party AI model providers (e.g., OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Anthropic) for processing. These providers are contractually limited to using your data for generation purposes only.
   Blockchain Public Ledger: Please be aware that your wallet address and transaction details are permanently recorded on the public Solana blockchain. We cannot delete or hide this information.
   Service Providers: We use trusted third parties for hosting (e.g., AWS, Vercel) and analytics.

5. DATA RETENTION
   Voice Models: Voice clones are retained only as long as you maintain an active account or until you manually delete them. You may delete a custom voice model at any time via your dashboard.
   Input Code: Codebases uploaded for analysis are processed in ephemeral sessions and are not permanently stored in our database after the session ends, unless you explicitly save the project to your workspace.
   Blockchain Data: On-chain data is immutable and stored permanently by the decentralized network, not by us.
6. YOUR RIGHTS: Depending on your location, you may have the right to:
   Access: Request a copy of the data we hold about you.
   Delete: Request the deletion of your account and off-chain data (email, voice models). Note: We cannot delete data from the blockchain.
   Rectify: Correct inaccurate information.
   To exercise these rights, contact us at: weaveitagent@gmail.com.
7. SECURITY We use industry-standard encryption (TLS/SSL) to protect your data in transit. Voice samples and sensitive inputs are stored using encryption-at-rest. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS: WeaveItAgent operates globally. By using the Service, you acknowledge that your data may be transferred to and processed in servers located in the United States or other jurisdictions where our AI providers operate.
9. COOKIES: We use essential cookies to maintain your session and preferences. We may use analytics cookies to understand how users interact with the platform. You can control cookies through your browser settings.
10. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY: We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes via the platform. Your continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
11. CONTACT US: If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: weaveitagent@gmail.com.
