Last Updated: December 17, 2025

1. INTRODUCTION AND ACCEPTANCE These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") constitute a binding legal agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and WeaveItAgent ("WeaveIt," "we," "us," or "our").

By accessing the WeaveIt platform, connecting your Solana wallet, holding or transacting with the $WEAV token, or using our AI-driven educational tools (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.

2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE WeaveIt is a decentralized, intelligent, multimodal platform that transforms technical documentation, code repositories, and text into dynamic video tutorials, audio explainers, and interactive learning content using Artificial Intelligence. The Service operates on a "pay-per-prompt" model and subscription tiers.

3. WALLET CONNECTION AND ACCESS

3.1. Wallet Requirement: Access to core features requires connecting a compatible third-party cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) on the Solana blockchain.

3.2. Security: You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet and private keys. WeaveIt has no access to your private keys, cannot initiate transactions without your signature, and cannot recover your funds if you lose access to your wallet.

3.3. Eligibility: You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.

4. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DISCLAIMER

4.1. Accuracy Warning: The Services utilize Generative AI (Large Language Models) to create content. You acknowledge that AI systems are subject to "hallucinations" and may produce inaccurate, outdated, or incorrect code, explanations, or summaries.

4.2. No Professional Advice: WeaveIt is an educational aid, not a substitute for professional engineering or legal advice. You agree to independently verify all code and technical instructions before deploying them in a live or production environment.

4.3. Liability Waiver: WeaveIt is not liable for any bugs, security vulnerabilities, system failures, or data loss resulting from your use of code or tutorials generated by our platform.

5. USER CONTENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

5.1. Your Input: You retain ownership of the code, documentation, PDFs, and URLs you upload or input into WeaveIt ("User Input").

5.2. License to WeaveIt: By uploading User Input, you grant WeaveIt a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to process, analyze, and adapt your content solely for the purpose of generating the requested educational output.

5.3. Ownership of Output: Subject to your compliance with these Terms, WeaveIt assigns to you all rights, title, and interest in the specific video, audio, and text outputs generated by the Service for your input ("Output").

5.4. Platform IP: The underlying software, AI models, "Knowledge Workspace," algorithms, and the WeaveIt brand remain the exclusive property of WeaveItAgent.

6. PAYMENTS AND REFUND POLICY

6.1. Payment Methods: Services are paid via fiat currency or $WEAV tokens.

6.2. No Refunds: Due to the irreversible computational costs associated with Generative AI and blockchain transactions, all sales are final. We generally do not offer refunds for "pay-per-prompt" generations or subscriptions, regardless of your satisfaction with the AI output.

6.3. Pricing Changes: We reserve the right to modify pricing (in fiat or $WEAV) at any time.

7. VOICE CLONING AND ETHICAL USE

7.1. Authorization: You may only use the voice cloning feature to clone your own voice or the voice of a person who has given you explicit, written consent.

Clone the voices of politicians, celebrities, or public figures without their consent.

Create "deepfakes" intended to deceive, defraud, or mislead others.

Generate hate speech, harassment, defamatory content, or content that promotes violence.

7.3. Enforcement: Violation of this section will result in an immediate permanent ban from the platform and the blacklisting of your wallet address. We reserve the right to report illegal use to relevant authorities.

8. $WEAV TOKENOMICS AND RISKS

8.1. Utility Token Only: The $WEAV token is strictly a utility token designed to access compute power and features within the WeaveIt ecosystem. It is not a security, stock, or investment contract.

8.2. No Expectation of Profit: You agree that you are not purchasing $WEAV with the expectation of profit derived from the efforts of WeaveItAgent or any third party.

8.3. Volatility: Crypto assets are highly volatile. You assume all risks associated with the purchase, holding, and use of $WEAV. WeaveItAgent is not responsible for any financial loss due to token price fluctuations or smart contract exploits.

9. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES You agree not to:

Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the WeaveIt platform.

Use the Service to generate malicious code (malware, viruses, exploits).

Upload content that infringes on the Intellectual Property rights of others.

Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WEAVEITAGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.

11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION

11.1. Binding Arbitration: In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, the parties agree to resolve the matter through binding arbitration, rather than in court. The arbitration shall be conducted by a neutral arbitrator agreed upon by both parties.

11.3. Global Enforcement: The parties agree that this arbitration clause is intended to be enforceable globally, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

12. MODIFICATIONS WeaveItAgent reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of material changes via the platform or official community channels. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
